# This is a placeholder for startup.wav sound file
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary WAV audio file
# For development purposes, this text file serves as a placeholder

# To add actual sound files:
# 1. Record or download appropriate WAV files (16-bit, 44.1kHz recommended)
# 2. Replace this placeholder with actual audio files
# 3. Ensure files are named:
#    - startup.wav (system startup sound)
#    - success.wav (successful operation sound)
#    - error.wav (error notification sound)
#    - button_press.wav (button feedback sound)

# Placeholder content for startup sound

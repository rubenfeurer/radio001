# This is a placeholder for error.wav sound file
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary WAV audio file
# For development purposes, this text file serves as a placeholder

# To add actual sound files:
# 1. Record or download appropriate WAV files (16-bit, 44.1kHz recommended)
# 2. Replace this placeholder with actual audio files
# 3. Sound should be a short, distinctive error tone (0.5-1 second)
# 4. Use for error conditions like:
#    - Station connection failed
#    - Invalid volume setting
#    - Network error
#    - Hardware malfunction

# Placeholder content for error sound
